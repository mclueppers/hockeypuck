Show the blocklist configuration this server is running with: the origin it
stamps on the blocks it issues, and the origins whose blocks it honours.

against one of that origin's keys, so an empty trust list means every tombstone
offered to this server is refused. That is the default, and it is the safe way
round for a mechanism whose effect is to remove keys.

This reads configuration only; it does not touch the database.`,

Report the block held for each fingerprint: which origin issued it, the reason
code it carries if any, and how many signatures vouch for it.

trusted for its origin. That answers a different question from whether the block
was accepted when it arrived: trust can be withdrawn, and a signing key can be
rotated or removed from the keyserver, leaving blocks in place that would no
longer be admitted today.
