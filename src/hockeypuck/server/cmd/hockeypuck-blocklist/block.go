Issue a signed tombstone for each fingerprint: a certificate that takes the
blocked key's place, so that any copy of that key offered to this server is
refused, and the block is visible to reconciliation partners that trust this
origin.

The tombstone is signed with -sign-key, which binds this node's configured
origin to the block. Peers that do not trust that origin ignore it; this server
will refuse its own tombstone too, unless the configuration trusts the signing
key, so a block that is accepted here is one a peer could also accept.

Blocking replaces key material rather than deleting it, so the fingerprint's row
stays occupied and the key cannot simply be re-offered. Existing key material for
the fingerprint is replaced.

With -o, the tombstone is written to a file instead of being stored, for
submission elsewhere - to a running server over HKP, for instance, which needs no
downtime.`,
